# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository was great practice for working on HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. The app has different layouts that change at 1024px width for desktop type view vs a mobile/tablet view. Link in the top right will bring you back to make your own tweet if you get lost down the rabbit hole of tweets.
